# Logistic-Regression-Naive-Bayesian-Classification
The objective of the analysis was to explore the factors that influence CD4 cell levels in the hope that doctors may to prescribe more effective treatments at different stages of the AIDS disease and perhaps better understand the disease trajectory and health care options. More specifically, using a binary logistic regression, was used to estimate the probability of an outcome of CD4 cells above and below a threshold of 50 cells per cubic millimeter (cells/mm3).  Given the results of the logistical regression, a second analytical model, a Naive Bayesian Classification was used to estimate the class probability and specifically to determine if this model could improve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
