# Logistic-Regression-Naive-Bayesian-Classification

Logistic regression and Naive Bayesian Classification on the factors that influence CD4 cell levels in AIDS patients.

The dataset used for this project was the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) clinical trials study group 320 data from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.

The objective of the analysis was to explore the factors that influence CD4 cell levels in the hope that doctors may to prescribe more effective treatments at different stages of the AIDS disease and perhaps better understand the disease trajectory and health care options. More specifically, using a binary logistic regression, was used to estimate the probability of an outcome of CD4 cells above and below a threshold of 50 cells per cubic millimeter (cells/mm3).  Given the results of the logistical regression, a second analytical model, a Naive Bayesian Classification was used to estimate the class probability and specifically to determine if this model could improve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. 

This project involves using R to examine a dataset. The R script is included in the file "MHunfalvay_Assignment2.R". Instructions on how to use the program are included as comments in the R file. After opening the file, please read the instructions carefully before executing the code to ensure that the program functions correctly.
